# BalancedBraketsKata

## The Kata

Take an input string with X opening brackets [ and Y closing brackets ], in a random order.

Determine if the generated string of brackets is balanced, that is it consists of pairs of opening/closing brackets in thecorrect order with no matched opening and closing pairs.

The kata has been structured to be simple, yet loosely guided. You will need to make decisions just like you werewriting code for production.

The examples are not meant to guide your implementation, they are there merely to give examples.

Do not worry about input other than brackets and empty string.

## Examples

|input     |output|
|----------|------|
|(empty)   | “”   |
|[]        | OK   |
|[][]      | OK   |
|[[]]      | OK   |
|[[[][]]]  | OK   |
|][        | FAIL |
|][][      | FAIL |
|[][]][    | FAIL |


## Hint

Start off returning string.empty as the default condition. This will allow you properly work the red-green-refactorcycle.
